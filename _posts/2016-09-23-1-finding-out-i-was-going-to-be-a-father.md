Theresa woke me early one morning to tell me. She showed me a pregnancy test that was positive. Later on we confirmed with a trip to the doctor, but that morning as the news that I was going to be a father sunk in, I began to realize the awesome responsibility I was going to have. I drove very carefully to work that morning.
